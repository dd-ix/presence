        <p>
          In addition to supporting the community, we run the internet exchange DD-IX at locations in Dresden. DD-IX
          sees itself as an open, non-profit platform for all internet participants with a AS in the region of Saxony.

          Besides the peering LAN and our route servers for the core operation of the IXP, we run most of the systems of
          the association ourselves.

        <p>
          The association is made up of committed members who work voluntarily for the achievement of the goals. Even
          though the association seems to be technical through IXP operations we are also involved in non-technical
          areas.

          The work in the association is organized in different boards and working groups:
