      <h2 i18n>What is peering?</h2>
      <p i18n>
        Peering is a term from network technology. It provides for an association of ISPs (Internet Service Providers)
        or networks to enable data exchange between them. This data transfer between peering partners is free of charge
        and offers numerous advantages.

      <h2 i18n>Why should I peer?</h2>
      <p i18n>
        The goal of peering is to route traffic between participating networks more efficiently and avoid bottlenecks.
        Direct peering connections provided by the DD-IX allow network packets to take shorter and faster routes. This
        leads to improved network performance, which can result in a reduction in latency.

        Optimal routing of network packets is an important aspect of building a robust and efficient Internet, as it
        forms the basis for exchanging traffic between different regions and countries. Peering enables access to
        content and services hosted by other networks or ISPs without having to route all traffic over the public
        Internet.

      <h2 i18n>Your benefits of peering using DD-IX as an Internet Exchange Point:</h2>
      <p i18n>
        An IXP offers the improved performance already mentioned, since the data exchange between peering partners is
        exchanged directly. This reduces latency and transmission speeds can be improved.

        It also enables better resilience, as traffic can be transmitted even if a connection to a particular network is
        down, as long as there are alternative peering partners.

        Peering through an IXP (Internet Exchange Point) such as the DD-IX reduces the need for expensive Internet
        transit services because traffic can be routed directly through the IXP.
      </p>
      <p i18n>
        In addition, peering increases network reach and allows access to content and services hosted by other networks
        and ISPs.
